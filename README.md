# [Notes] Svelte Tutorial for Beginners - NetNinja

## What is Svelte?

- Is a compiler that creates reactive (for data changes) web apps and interfaces.
- This can be used in creating the entire site or just parts of it.

## Svelte vs. other frameworks

- Svelte is not a framework but a compiler.
- It compiles the code for production at build time into a single, vanilla JS bundle; Svelte libraries are not deployed.
- Extra scripts or libraries are not shipped to production.
- Results in a faster running website.

## Prerequisites

- HTML + CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js v8+
