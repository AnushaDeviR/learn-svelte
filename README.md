# Svelte - Props

- Values passes into components are called _properties (props)_

- In `export let message`, message is the prop being sent from `<Modal message={'I am a props'}/>` component. The `export` keyword indicates that the variable can be set from outside.

- The prop name and the variable name should be same.
